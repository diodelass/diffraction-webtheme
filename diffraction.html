<h2>[SCP] Extradimensional Optical Expansion Module</h2>
</summary>
<p>
<b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> SCP-9999 is to be kept powered and monitored at all times by an optical I/O apparatus capable of producing 
and discriminating wavelengths of 1064, 630, 532, 473, and 355 nm (corresponding to five harmonics of an Nd:YAG laser, pumped by either 1064 or 
946 nm). SCP-9999's power inputs are to be supplied with coherent light at 355 nm with a total average power not less than 36 W, distributed evenly 
across the four inputs. Light provided for power should be either continous-wave or pulsed at a rate of at least 120 kHz. SCP-9999's signal lines 
(all 60 lenses besides the four power inputs) will produce signals with an optical power of 23.52 ± 0.01 nW, and require stable input signals of at 
least 17.6 nW in order to reliably respond. Signal detectors and transmitters must be capable of receiving and modulating signals at frequencies of 
at least 1.22 GHz. An apparatus capable of meeting these specifications is presently constructed in the High-Speed Fourier Optics Laboratory at 
Research Site-72, where SCP-9999 is contained.<br>
<br>
Testing on SCP-9999 is approved with the consent and supervision of two Level-4/9999 researchers, pending review of all intended experimental 
procedures. Data collected from SCP-9999 experimentation is to be copied to the on-site archives at Site-72 and made available for study by all 
authorized researchers.<br>
<br>
<b>Description:</b> SCP-9999 is an electronic and optical device of unknown origin and purpose, enclosed in a rectangular housing measuring 69.85 x 
114.3 x 6.350 mm. The housing consists of a single monolithic piece of polytetrafluoroethylene, bearing very fine tool marks consistent with 
fabrication by a 0.5 mm rotary drill. Given the high level of precision achieved, it is assumed that this was a computer-numerical controlled (CNC) 
milling apparatus; however, X-ray and ultrasonic examination of the internals of SCP-9999 reveals spaces inside that could not have been reached by 
any conventionally-shaped drill, despite bearing tool marks from such. Internally, SCP-9999 primarily consists of a single large semiconductor die 
composed primarily of monocrystalline silicon carbide, on which highly complex electronic circuitry has been assembled by a vapor deposition process 
of several different additional semiconductor materials, including gallium arsenide, gallium sulfide, indium gallium nitride, and indium antimonide. 
Embedded within the structure are numerous long, thin cylindrical inclusions composed of highly pure fused quartz, inserted by an unknown process, 
which serve as optical fibers. 64 of these fibers emerge at two rows of lenses, 0.5 mm in diameter, situated at the bottom of 0.8-mm-deep holes in 
one of the narrow ends of SCP-9999's housing. These holes are the only openings in the housing of SCP-9999, and appear to be intended as a digital 
optical interface. The top surface of SCP-9999 (defined by convention, as no particular intended orientation for SCP-9999 is apparent) is marked 
with an indentation in the shape of an equilateral triangle, 23.3 mm on a side, which appears to point towards the optical interface lenses; the 
significance of this marking is unclear.<br>
<br>
The exact internal layout of SCP-9999's circuitry appears highly variable and dynamic when imaged via X-ray, appearing completely different for 
slightly different viewing angles or X-ray energies. Imaging using a conventional bremmstrahlung X-ray source produces highly chaotic and nonsensical 
results, often appearing to show multiple distinct structures occupying the same physical space. Probing with highly coherent and monochromatic 
X-rays reveals that the topology of SCP-9999, in addition to being composed of multiple discrete layers of material as with common semiconductor 
dies, also consists of multiple three-dimensional "slices" which can be viewed individually by varying the angle of observation and X-ray incidence, 
each appearing to occupy the same space. The exact number of these slices contained by SCP-9999 is not presently known due to difficulty in 
distinguishing them at extreme viewing angles, but is known to be at least 2,500. It is currently suspected that SCP-9999's structure makes use of 
more than three spatial dimensions, but it is not known how this is accomplished. Establishing a complete and accurate map of SCP-9999's layout is to 
be considered a high priority.<br>
<br>
SCP-9999 activates whenever highly coherent light of sufficient intensity is applied to any or all of the four lenses at the corners of its interface 
end. Spectral response is typical for InGaN photodiode-based collectors - in particular, blue to ultraviolet light is capable of powering SCP-9999, 
with the maximum efficiency existing between 300 and 500 nm. Notably, conversion of optical energy into electrical energy within SCP-9999 is no more 
efficient than expected, with a total net conversion rate of no more than 40%. As a result, applying the minimum power necessary to activate SCP-9999 
(approximately 35.2 W in total, between the four power inputs) results in the production of at least 9.1 W of heat, concentrated at four points about 
3.2 mm directly behind the input lenses. Four bare copper panels, each a square measuring 93.2 mm on a side, are set into SCP-9999's casing directly 
above these points, and are assumed to be intended as attachment surfaces for heat dissipation devices. The efficiency with which SCP-9999 converts 
light energy into electrical energy varies dramatically during operation, sometimes falling to less than 1% during "idle" periods; scaling the input 
laser power based on heat production to keep the total waste heat output between 9.1 and 10 W appears to have no detrimental effects on SCP-9999's 
operation and reliably prevents overheating. Total heat production across SCP-9999's volume does not equal the total input power as expected, with 
nearly all optical energy which is not immediately lost as heat at the inputs seeming to vanish, and SCP-9999's exterior temperature often remaining 
significantly cooler (as of current observations, 6.32 C° at most) than its surroundings. SCP-9999 appears quite tolerant of pulsed or intermittent 
input power, beginning to show signs of shutdown no sooner than 3.254 s after power is removed, and recovering from outages within 22 ns upon 
reapplication of power.<br>
<br>
While active, SCP-9999 transmits and receives data over its 60 data lenses. The top row (corresponding to the side of the casing marked with the 
aforementioned triangular indentation) transmits optical data using an asynchronous encoding scheme, making use of five different wavelengths of light 
(1064, 630, 532, 473, and 355 nm) to transmit five independent data streams at once. The bottom row of lenses serves as a receiver for similarly-encoded 
data. SCP-9999's reception tolerances are very strict, requiring data to be split evenly across the five wavelengths (with the same number of bits 
transmitted on each wavelength) and modulated with a timing jitter of no more than 20 parts per million. Authorized personnel may consult document 
9999-A9 for the complete set of known signaling parameters required by SCP-9999. In the event of a malformed input message, SCP-9999 will produce a 
perfunctory error message and reset, either returning to its initial power-on state or restarting the current activity. SCP-9999 appears to support 
several different modulation frequencies, with the lowest being 1.22 GHz. Analysis of SCP-9999's initialization routine suggests that it also supports 
frequencies of 6.10, 30.51, 152.6, and 762.9 GHz, and at least two even higher frequencies which have not yet been successfully measured. SCP-9999's 
maximum average data throughput in a single direction is estimated to be at over 100 terabits per second, although current laser generation, detection, 
and data processing technology available to the Foundation is capable of communicating no faster than 37.2 gigabits per second. The speed at which 
SCP-9999 modulates signals is not currently well-understood, as it appears to contradict fundamental limitations on the response time of semiconductor 
devices.<br>
<br>
Markings and grooves on the exterior of SCP-9999 seem to indicate that it is intended to be inserted into a larger device, in a manner similar to a 
PCMCIA expansion module for a conventional portable computer. At present, no devices with receptacles capable of accepting SCP-9999 have been located. 
It is unknown why SCP-9999 appears to be intended as a modular component, or what the function of an apparatus designed to accept SCP-9999 would be.<br>
